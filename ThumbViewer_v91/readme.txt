' This version is greatly improved.

' The sample form shows how to initiate the control and
' load it with images.
' The code and commenting could be better but it works
' well and what do you expect for free!

' v.90
' This control is based on code obtained from a larger
' image viewing application written by Ramón A. Gimenez
' The original app was in Spanish and provided a number
' of image viewing functions. The most useful was the
' thumbnail viewer, and it was to well integrated into
' the host app to be useful in other programs.
' This control is the result of extracting the thumbnail
' viewer of the program in addition to translating the code
' from Spanish to English (I don't speak Spanish).
' It is now a self-contained user control that can be
' easily added to any project.
'
' The code is copyrighted by its respective owners, but
' can be used in any project you want.
